![SurfCode](/SurfAndCode.png "Surf & Code")

I would like to thank all the people from [le wagon][lewagon], which is a coding school in Paris, for organizing a great [boot and surf camp][surf&code]! Those guys had the brilliant idea to combine, in a two weeks program, surf sessions and code teaching lessons. This event took place in Soustons, close to some of the greatest surf spots of the south west part of France. This solve the problem of the surf camp too dependant of the waves. I manage, with the help of [Sebastien Saunier][SSaunier], to design this website.
